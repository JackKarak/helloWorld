  <h2>Who I Am</h2>
  <p>
    I’m a driven student at the University of Maryland passionate about blending business, technology, and leadership.
    As part of the QUEST Honors Program, I thrive in team-based environments that challenge me to solve complex, real-world problems for real clients.
    Beyond the classroom, I’m also a member of UMD’s club roller hockey team, where I compete and lead with the same discipline I bring to my professional goals.
  </p>

  <h2>What I’m Working On</h2>
  <p>
    In the QUEST Honors Program, my team and I are working on our consulting capstone project — collaborating with a client to improve operational efficiency and data-driven decision-making.
    Our project combines systems thinking, supply chain analysis, and dashboard prototyping to deliver measurable business impact.
    Previously, I’ve worked on product development and data analytics projects that involved designing efficient processes and applying structured problem-solving techniques.
